# Maze-Solving Robot Project

The coursework on a robotics course at the School of Computing (UEF). My friends and I built and programmed a maze-solving robot.

## üìñ Introduction
Our goal was to build a maze-solving robot using the left-hand wall-following algorithm. The robot makes left turns whenever possible, moves straight if the left path is blocked, and turns right or performs a 180-degree turn when necessary. By repeating this logic, the robot successfully navigates out of the maze.
